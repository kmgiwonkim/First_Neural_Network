# First_Neural_Network
- Wow! This code sucks! I didn't know anything about OOP, now its time to apply some after 3 years :D
- Single-Digit Image recognition neural network, with adjustable layer sizes
- Utilized the MNIST Database
- Recognizes 28x28 pixel hand-drawn numbers
- 97% accuracy
- To test; get file Data.zip and unzip into same folder as Main.py

To be Added:
- Alphabet Recognition

To be Explored:
- Softmax
- Cross Entropy

V2.0.0
- Overhaul to OOP currently in Development!

V1.1.0
- EMNIST Database was added
- Can reach up to 97%* Accuracy
  - The accuracy changes when the parameters are trained in MNIST and tested in EMNIST and vice versa
  - EMNIST trained -> MNIST tested: around 75% accuracy
- Code cleanup

V1.0.0
- First pratical version
- About 95% Accuracy
- Slight improvements made on the UI
- Minor Optimizations

V0.2.0
- Added UI
- Uses Pickle to store var
- Major optimizations
- Does not run... yet. (wait for V0.2.1)

V0.1.0
- First version to actually run
- Saves variables in an external .txt file
- Separate files to generate a random set of weights and biases
