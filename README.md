# First_Neural_Network
- Still developing
- Single-Digit Image recognition neural network, with adjustable layer sizes
- Utilized the MNIST Database
- Recognizes 28x28 pixel hand-drawn numbers
- lowest cost acheived so far: 0.0430 (95% accuracy)

To be Added:
- EMNIST Database 
- Alphabet Recognition

V1.0.0
- First pratical version
- About 95% Accuracy
- Slight improvements made on the UI
- Minor Optimizations

V0.2.0
- Added UI
- Uses Pickle to store var
- Major optimizations
- Does not run... yet. (wait for V0.2.1)

V0.1.0
- First version to actually run
