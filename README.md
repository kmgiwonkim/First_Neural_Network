# First_Neural_Network
- Still developing
- Lacks what they call 'Programming discipline'
- Image recognition neural network, with adjustable layer sizes
- 'tries' to recognize 28x28 pixel hand-drawn numbers from the MNIST Database
- lowest cost acheived so far: 0.894 (a.k.a., does not work)

V0.2.0
- Added UI
- Uses Pickle to store var
- Major optimization
- Does not run... yet. (wait for V0.2.1)

V0.1.0
- First version to actually run
- Saves variables in an external .txt file
- Separate files to generate a random set of weights and biases
